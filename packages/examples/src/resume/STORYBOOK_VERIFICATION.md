# Storybook Verification Documentation

## Introduction
This document outlines the testing process and results for the Storybook stories created for the `react-pdf` project, specifically within the `packages/examples/src/resume` directory.

## Testing Process
Each component's story was verified by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the Storybook UI at `http://localhost:6006/`.
2. Select the component from the navigation pane.
3. Visually inspect the rendered component in the main pane to ensure it matches the expected output.
4. Interact with the controls in the 'Controls' tab to dynamically test different input values.
5. Take screenshots as evidence of functionality.

## Results

### Skills Component
- **Default Story**: Renders with a list of skills as expected.
- **With Subtitle Story**: Renders with a subtitle and a list of skills as expected.
- **Empty Story**: Renders with no skills, representing the empty state correctly.

### Education Component
- **Default Story**: Displays education entries with school name, degree, and date as expected.

### Experience Component
- **Default Story**: Lists various roles with corresponding responsibilities and achievements as expected.

## Screenshots
Screenshots have been saved in the `/home/ubuntu/screenshots/` directory to provide visual evidence of the stories' functionality.

- Skills Default Story: `skills_default.png`
- Skills With Subtitle Story: `skills_with_subtitle.png`
- Skills Empty Story: `skills_empty.png`
- Education Default Story: `education_default.png`

## Conclusion
All tested stories are functioning as expected, with controls allowing for dynamic testing and no rendering errors observed. This verification ensures that the components within the Storybook UI are ready for use and further development.
