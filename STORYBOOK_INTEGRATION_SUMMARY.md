# Storybook Integration Summary for react-pdf

## Introduction
This document provides a summary of the findings and reasoning behind the prioritization of specific components from the react-pdf library for Storybook integration. The components were selected based on their potential for reuse, complexity, centrality to the library's functionality, and the value they add to the Storybook as interactive documentation and examples.

## Prioritized Components
The following components have been identified and prioritized for Storybook integration:

1. **Page Component (Page.jsx)**
   - **Role**: Represents a single page within a PDF document, a fundamental building block for any PDF.
   - **Reason for Prioritization**: It is crucial for defining the structure and layout of the content, making it an essential component for demonstration in Storybook.

2. **Header Component (Header.jsx)**
   - **Role**: Used to render headers in PDF documents, typically containing titles or important information.
   - **Reason for Prioritization**: Headers are a common feature in document design, and showcasing different header styles and contents in Storybook would provide valuable examples for developers.

3. **Button Component (Button.jsx)**
   - **Role**: While not a standard part of static PDFs, buttons can be used for interactive PDFs or to trigger actions within Storybook.
   - **Reason for Prioritization**: Interactive elements like buttons are less common in PDFs but can be very useful in interactive documents or demonstrations within Storybook.

## Conclusion
The components listed above are integral to the react-pdf library and provide clear use cases for Storybook stories. The existing `.stories.js` files for these components indicate that some groundwork has already been laid, which can be expanded upon to showcase a wider range of use cases and variations. The prioritization was based on the components' roles in document structure, their potential for reuse, and the interactive documentation they can provide within Storybook.
